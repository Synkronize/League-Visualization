# League-Visualization
League Visualization,  uses the League of Legends API along with all the tools
mentioned above  to pull some data from the game, and visualize it on the browser. Currently it
lists the frequency of times that a user loses to various champions, by looking at their past
hundred games. Alternatively, the user can also examine their most recent game, and view
graphs of the differentials between them and their counterpart in the game. I say counterpart,
because each of the five players in a League match has a role in the game, and likewise the
enemy teamâ€™s roles mirror those roles so the user usually always has a counterpart on the enemy
team. The differentials range from how much of a gold difference there is between the user and
their counterpart, to the difference in damage taken between the two players.
